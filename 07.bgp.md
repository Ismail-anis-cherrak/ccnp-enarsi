# Comprehensive BGP Configuration Guide

## Basic BGP Configuration

### Basic BGP Configuration Commands

```plaintext
router bgp <AS_NUMBER>
 bgp router-id <ROUTER_ID>
 network <NETWORK_ADDRESS> mask <SUBNET_MASK>
 neighbor <NEIGHBOR_IP> remote-as <NEIGHBOR_AS>
 neighbor <NEIGHBOR_IP> update-source <SOURCE_INTERFACE>
```

- **AS_NUMBER**: The Autonomous System number for BGP. This number must be consistent within the AS.
- **ROUTER_ID**: A unique identifier for the BGP router. Typically set to an IP address format.
- **NETWORK_ADDRESS**: The network to advertise in BGP.
- **SUBNET_MASK**: The subnet mask of the network address.
- **NEIGHBOR_IP**: The IP address of the BGP peer.
- **NEIGHBOR_AS**: The AS number of the BGP neighbor.
- **update-source**: Specifies the source interface or IP for BGP updates, helpful in scenarios where the peer is not directly connected.

### Example

**Router A Configuration:**

```plaintext
router bgp 65001
 bgp router-id 1.1.1.1
 network 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0
 neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 65002
 neighbor 10.0.0.2 update-source Loopback0
```

**Router B Configuration:**

```plaintext
router bgp 65002
 bgp router-id 2.2.2.2
 network 10.0.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0
 neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 65001
 neighbor 10.0.0.1 update-source Loopback0
```

In this setup, Router A and Router B use loopback interfaces to establish their BGP session, allowing the BGP peering to be maintained even if the directly connected interfaces go down.

## Changing BGP Attributes Using Route-Map

### Route-Map Configuration

```plaintext
route-map <MAP_NAME> permit <SEQUENCE_NUMBER>
 match ip address <ACL_NUMBER>
 set <ATTRIBUTE> <VALUE>
```

- **MAP_NAME**: The name of the route-map used in BGP configurations.
- **SEQUENCE_NUMBER**: The sequence number that determines the order of route-map entries.
- **ACL_NUMBER**: The access control list number to match specific routes.
- **ATTRIBUTE**: BGP attribute to modify (e.g., `local-preference`, `weight`, `as-path`).
- **VALUE**: The value to set for the specified attribute.

### Examples

**Router A Configuration:**

```plaintext
ip access-list standard 10
 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255

route-map SET_LOCAL_PREF permit 10
 match ip address 10
 set local-preference 200

route-map SET_WEIGHT permit 20
 match ip address 10
 set weight 100

router bgp 65001
 neighbor 10.0.0.2 route-map SET_LOCAL_PREF out
 neighbor 10.0.0.2 route-map SET_WEIGHT in
```

- **SET_LOCAL_PREF**: Sets the local preference for routes matching ACL 10 before sending to neighbor `10.0.0.2`.
- **SET_WEIGHT**: Sets the BGP weight for routes matching ACL 10 before receiving from neighbor `10.0.0.2`.

## BGP Route Summarization

### Route Summarization Commands

```plaintext
router bgp <AS_NUMBER>
 aggregate-address <SUMMARY_ADDRESS> <SUMMARY_MASK> summary-only
```

- **SUMMARY_ADDRESS**: The network address to be used for summarization.
- **SUMMARY_MASK**: The mask for the summarized route.

### Examples

**Router A Configuration:**

```plaintext
router bgp 65001
 aggregate-address 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only
```

This command configures Router A to summarize routes within the `192.168.0.0/16` range into a single summarized route.

## BGP Using Loopback Interfaces

### Loopback Interface Configuration

Using loopback interfaces for BGP peering enhances stability since loopback interfaces are less likely to go down compared to physical interfaces.

### Example

**Router A Configuration:**

```plaintext
interface Loopback0
 ip address 192.168.100.1 255.255.255.255

router bgp 65001
 bgp router-id 1.1.1.1
 network 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0
 neighbor 192.168.100.2 remote-as 65002
 neighbor 192.168.100.2 update-source Loopback0
```

**Router B Configuration:**

```plaintext
interface Loopback0
 ip address 192.168.100.2 255.255.255.255

router bgp 65002
 bgp router-id 2.2.2.2
 network 10.0.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0
 neighbor 192.168.100.1 remote-as 65001
 neighbor 192.168.100.1 update-source Loopback0
```

In this configuration, BGP peering is established over the loopback interfaces `192.168.100.1` and `192.168.100.2`.

## Advanced BGP Attributes and Manipulations

### BGP Path Attributes

- **Local Preference**: Influences outbound routing decisions within an AS.
  ```plaintext
  set local-preference <VALUE>
  ```

- **Weight**: Cisco-specific attribute that affects routing decisions within a router.
  ```plaintext
  set weight <VALUE>
  ```

- **AS Path Prepend**: Modifies the AS path to influence route preference.
  ```plaintext
  set as-path prepend <AS_NUMBER>
  ```

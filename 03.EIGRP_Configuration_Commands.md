# EIGRP Configuration Commands

## Basic EIGRP Configuration

```plaintext
router eigrp <AS_NUMBER>
 network <NETWORK_ADDRESS> <WILDCARD_MASK>
```

- **AS_NUMBER**: The Autonomous System number for EIGRP. This must match across all routers within the same EIGRP domain.
  
- **NETWORK_ADDRESS**: The network address to be advertised by EIGRP. This is specified using the classful network address.

- **WILDCARD_MASK**: The inverse of the subnet mask, used to specify a range of IP addresses within the network. This provides precise control over which interfaces participate in EIGRP.

**Example:**

```plaintext
router eigrp 100
 network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
```

This configuration sets up EIGRP for AS 100 and advertises the 192.168.10.0/24 network.

## EIGRP Configuration (Improved Approach)

```plaintext
router eigrp <AS_NUMBER>
 network <NETWORK_ADDRESS> <WILDCARD_MASK>
 passive-interface default
 no passive-interface <INTERFACE_NAME>
```

- **passive-interface default**: Configures all interfaces to passive mode, preventing them from sending or receiving EIGRP updates. Useful for enhancing security and reducing unnecessary traffic.

- **no passive-interface**: Specifies interfaces that will actively participate in EIGRP, allowing them to send and receive updates.

**Example:**

```plaintext
router eigrp 100
 network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
 passive-interface default
 no passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0
```

This configuration enables EIGRP on the 192.168.1.0/24 network and makes only the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface active.

## EIGRP Configuration Using Network 0.0.0.0

```plaintext
router eigrp <AS_NUMBER>
 network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
```

- Configuring `network 0.0.0.0` with a wildcard mask of `255.255.255.255` includes all interfaces on the router in the EIGRP process. Useful for dynamic environments or during testing.

**Example:**

```plaintext
router eigrp 100
 network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
```

This enables EIGRP on all interfaces with assigned IP addresses, within AS 100.

## Show Commands in EIGRP

```plaintext
show ip eigrp neighbors
show ip eigrp topology
show ip eigrp interfaces
show ip route eigrp
```

- **show ip eigrp neighbors**: Displays information about EIGRP neighbors, including IP addresses and hold times.

- **show ip eigrp topology**: Shows the EIGRP topology table, which includes routes and feasible successors.

- **show ip eigrp interfaces**: Lists interfaces participating in EIGRP.

- **show ip route eigrp**: Displays routes learned via EIGRP.

**Examples:**

```plaintext
show ip eigrp neighbors
```
Outputs the list of EIGRP neighbors with established adjacency.

```plaintext
show ip eigrp topology
```
Displays the EIGRP topology table, indicating all known routes and their metrics.

## Changing EIGRP Parameters

```plaintext
router eigrp <AS_NUMBER>
 metric weights 0 <K1> <K2> <K3> <K4> <K5>
 delay <DELAY> <INTERFACE_NAME>
 bandwidth <BANDWIDTH> <INTERFACE_NAME>
 maximum-paths <VALUE>
 variance <MULTIPLIER>
```

- **metric weights**: Adjusts the K-values influencing EIGRP's metric calculation. The values include:
  - **K1 (Bandwidth)**: Emphasizes the bandwidth of a link.
  - **K2 (Load)**: Considers the load of a link.
  - **K3 (Delay)**: Takes into account the delay across a path.
  - **K4 (Reliability)** and **K5 (MTU)**: Generally not used.

- **delay**: Sets the delay on an interface in tens of microseconds, affecting the EIGRP metric.

- **bandwidth**: Specifies the bandwidth of an interface in kilobits per second, impacting the EIGRP metric.

- **maximum-paths**: Limits the number of equal-cost paths EIGRP can use for load balancing.

- **variance**: Allows for unequal-cost load balancing by defining a multiplier for the feasible distance.

**Examples:**

```plaintext
router eigrp 100
 metric weights 0 1 0 1 0 0
 delay 1000 GigabitEthernet0/0
 bandwidth 100000 GigabitEthernet0/1
 maximum-paths 4
 variance 2
```

Configures EIGRP with specific metric weights, sets delay on GigabitEthernet0/0, assigns bandwidth to GigabitEthernet0/1, and configures load balancing with variance.

## EIGRP Stub Configuration

```plaintext
router eigrp <AS_NUMBER>
 eigrp stub <OPTION>
```

- **Options**: EIGRP stub options include:
  - **receive-only**: The router only receives EIGRP updates, not advertising any routes.
  - **connected**: Only connected routes are advertised.
  - **static**: Only static routes are advertised.
  - **summary**: Only summary routes are advertised.
  - **redistributed**: Only redistributed routes are advertised.

- The EIGRP stub feature helps in limiting route propagation, especially useful in hub-and-spoke topologies.

**Examples:**

```plaintext
router eigrp 100
 eigrp stub connected
```

Advertises only connected routes.

```plaintext
router eigrp 100
 eigrp stub static
```

Advertises only static routes.

```plaintext
router eigrp 100
 eigrp stub summary
```

Advertises only summary routes.

```plaintext
router eigrp 100
 eigrp stub connected static summary
```

Advertises connected, static, and summary routes only.

## EIGRP Authentication & Key Chain

```plaintext
key chain <KEY_CHAIN_NAME>
 key <KEY_ID>
  key-string <KEY>
  accept-lifetime <START_TIME> <END_TIME>
  send-lifetime <START_TIME> <END_TIME>

interface <INTERFACE_NAME>
 ip authentication mode eigrp <AS_NUMBER> md5
 ip authentication key-chain eigrp <AS_NUMBER> <KEY_CHAIN_NAME>
```

- **key chain**: Defines a sequence of keys used for authentication.

- **key**: Specifies the key ID and string, along with lifetimes for when the key is accepted and sent.

- **ip authentication mode eigrp**: Enables MD5 authentication for EIGRP on an interface, ensuring that only trusted routers can establish EIGRP adjacencies.

- **ip authentication key-chain eigrp**: Associates a key chain with EIGRP on a specific interface.

**Example:**

```plaintext
key chain EIGRP_KEYS
 key 1
  key-string MYSECRET1
  accept-lifetime 00:00:00 August 8 2024 23:59:59 August 8 2025
  send-lifetime 00:00:00 August 8 2024 23:59:59 August 8 2025
 key 2
  key-string MYSECRET2
  accept-lifetime 00:00:00 August 9 2024 23:59:59 August 9 2025
  send-lifetime 00:00:00 August 9 2024 23:59:59 August 9 2025

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip authentication mode eigrp 100 md5
 ip authentication key-chain eigrp 100 EIGRP_KEYS
```

Configures MD5 authentication for EIGRP on the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface using a key chain named `EIGRP_KEYS` with multiple keys.

## EIGRP Filtering

```plaintext
access-list <ACL_NUMBER> permit <NETWORK_ADDRESS> <WILDCARD_MASK>
access-list <ACL_NUMBER> deny <NETWORK_ADDRESS> <WILDCARD_MASK>

router eigrp <AS_NUMBER>
 distribute-list <ACL_NUMBER> in <INTERFACE_NAME>
 distribute-list <ACL_NUMBER> out <INTERFACE_NAME>
```

- **access-list**: Defines access control lists (ACLs) to filter routes.

- **distribute-list**: Uses ACLs to filter incoming or outgoing routes.

- **in**: Filters routes being received on a specified interface.

- **out**: Filters routes being sent out on a specified interface.

**Examples:**

```plaintext
access-list 10 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 10 deny any
access-list 20 permit 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 20 deny any

router eigrp 100
 distribute-list 10 in GigabitEthernet0/0
 distribute-list 20 out GigabitEthernet0/1
```

- **access-list 10**: Permits 192.168.10.0/24 and denies all other

 routes.
- **access-list 20**: Permits 10.0.0.0/24 and denies all other routes.
- **distribute-list 10 in**: Filters incoming routes on GigabitEthernet0/0.
- **distribute-list 20 out**: Filters outgoing routes on GigabitEthernet0/1.

# OSPF SPF Overview

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) uses the SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm to calculate routes within an OSPF network. The way SPF is executed can be categorized into two methods: Full SPF and Partial SPF.

## Full SPF

Full SPF involves recalculating the shortest paths to all destinations within an OSPF area whenever there is a change in the network topology. This comprehensive recalculation ensures that the routing table is updated with the most current path information across the entire area.

### Example Scenario

Imagine a network with multiple OSPF areas:

- **Area 0 (Backbone Area):** Contains routers R1, R2, and R3.
- **Area 1:** Connected to Area 0 through ABRs (Area Border Routers) R2 and R3.

#### Example of Full SPF:

If a topology change occurs in Area 0, such as a link failure between R1 and R2, OSPF triggers a full SPF recalculation. This process involves recalculating the shortest paths to all networks within Area 0 and propagating the updated routing information to Area 1 via ABRs R2 and R3.

#### Show Command Example for Full SPF:

```bash
show ip ospf statistics algorithm
```

**Results:**
```
Area 0 SPF algorithms executed 5 times
Area 11 SPF algorithms executed 3 times
```

Explanation:
- The command output shows that OSPF executed the SPF algorithm 5 times in Area 0 and 3 times in Area 11. This indicates frequent recalculations due to topology changes in these areas.

## Partial SPF

Partial SPF recalculates the shortest paths only for the affected part of the network following a topology change. This approach optimizes resources by focusing computation on the affected areas or routers rather than the entire network.

### Example Scenario

Continuing from the previous example:

#### Example of Partial SPF:

If a topology change occurs within Area 1, such as a link failure between routers R2 and R3, OSPF performs a partial SPF recalculation. This process recalculates the shortest paths within Area 1 without affecting the routing calculations in other OSPF areas.

#### Show Command Example for Partial SPF:

```bash
show ip ospf statistics 1 a algorithm
```

**Results:**
```
Area 01 SPF algorithms executed 7 times
```

Explanation:
- This command output indicates that OSPF executed the SPF algorithm 7 times in Area 01, reflecting recalculations due to changes specifically within that area.

## LSA Type 4 and LSA Type 5

In OSPF, Link State Advertisements (LSAs) are used to describe the network topology. LSA Type 4 and Type 5 are particularly relevant in OSPF:

- **LSA Type 4 (ASBR Summary Link)**: Describes the AS Boundary Router (ASBR) and is used by ABRs to advertise AS external routes into the OSPF domain.
  
- **LSA Type 5 (AS External Link)**: Advertises external routes (routes redistributed into OSPF) throughout the OSPF domain.

### Example Commands and Results

#### 1. Show OSPF Database External

```bash
R3# show ip ospf database external 192.160.2.0
```

**Results:**
```
LS age: 1969
LS Type: AS External Link
Link State ID: 192.160.2.0 (External Network Number)
Advertising Router: 2.2.2.2
LS Seq Number: 80000028
Network Mask: /24
Metric Type: 2 (Larger than any link state path)
TOS: 0
Metric: 705
Forward Address: 0.0.0.0
External Route Tag: 20
```

#### 2. Show IP OSPF Database ASBR-Summary

```bash
R3# show ip ospf database asbr-summary
```

**Results:**
```
LS age: 923
LS Type: Summary Links (AS Boundary Router)
Link State ID: 2.2.2.2 (AS Boundary Router address)
Advertising Router: 1.1.1.1
LS Seq Number: 0000000A
Checksum: 0x12PP
Length: 28
Network Mask: /0
TOS: 0
Metric: 0
```

### Inter-area Summarization

Inter-area summarization in OSPF allows summarizing routes advertised into OSPF domains, reducing the size of routing tables and controlling the propagation of routing information.

#### ABR Configuration Example

Suppose we have a network with four subnets: 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, and 192.168.3.0/24. To simplify routing and reduce the size of routing tables, we apply inter-area summarization to these networks:

Old Mask: 255.255.255.0 (or /24)
New Mask: 255.255.252.0 (or /22)


```bash
ABR(config)# router ospf 1
ABR(config-router)# area 1 range 192.168.0.0 255.255.252.0 advertise
ABR(config-router)# area 1 range 192.168.0.0 255.255.252.0 cost 10
```

- **advertise**: Sets the address range status to advertise and generates a type 3 summary LSA.
- **not-advertise**: Sets the address range status to DoNotAdvertise. The Type 3 summary LSA is suppressed, and the component networks remain hidden from other areas.
- **cost**: Specifies the metric or cost for the summary route, used during OSPF SPF calculations to determine the shortest paths to the destination.

### Additional OSPF Configuration

#### ASBR Configuration Example

```bash
ASBR(config)# router ospf 1
ASBR(config-router)# summary-address 192.168.0.0 255.255.252.0 not-advertise
ASBR(config-router)# summary-address 192.168.0.0 255.255.252.0 tag 100
ASBR(config-router)# summary-address 192.168.0.0 255.255.252.0 nssa-only
```

- **not-advertise**: Suppresses routes that match the specified prefix/mask pair. This keyword applies to OSPF only.
- **tag**: Specifies a tag value used as a "match" value for controlling redistribution via route maps. This keyword applies to OSPF only.
- **nssa-only**: Instructs the device to originate Type-7 LSAs with a cleared P-bit, preventing translation of LSAs to Type 5 on NSSA ABR routers.

### OSPF Area Types and Commands


#### 1. Standard Area (Stub)
A stub area is an OSPF area that does not receive external routes (Type 5 LSAs) from other areas.

##### Configuration Example:

```bash
router ospf 1
area 1 stub
```

#### 2. Totally Stubby Area
A totally stubby area is similar to a stub area but also prevents Type 3 LSAs (summary LSAs) from being sent into the area, further reducing routing table size.

##### Configuration Example:

```bash
router ospf 1
area 2 stub no-summary
```

#### 3. Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)

NSSAs allow OSPF to import external routes from other routing protocols into OSPF without turning them into Type 5 LSAs, but using type 7 LSAs.
##### Configuration Example:
```bash
router ospf 1
area 3 nssa
```

#### 4. Totally NSSA
A totally NSSA is similar to an NSSA but prevents Type 3 LSAs (summary LSAs) from being sent into the area.

##### Configuration Example:
```bash
router ospf 1
area 4 nssa no-summary
```

#### 5. Backbone Area (Area 0)
Area 0, also known as the backbone area, connects all other OSPF areas within a single OSPF domain.

##### Configuration Example:
```bash
router ospf 1
area 0
```
#### 6. Transit Area
Transit areas are used to connect multiple OSPF areas, facilitating inter-area communication.

##### Configuration Example:
```bash
router ospf 1
area 5
```



# OSPF Virtual Link

## Overview
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol used for routing IP packets within a single routing domain. OSPF uses the concept of areas to partition a network into smaller, more manageable segments. An area is a logical grouping of network segments and routers that share the same area ID.

### Virtual Link
A virtual link in OSPF is used to connect an OSPF area that does not have a direct physical connection to the backbone area (Area 0). This is essential for maintaining OSPF's hierarchical structure and ensuring all areas can communicate through the backbone.

In the given scenario, we have three areas:
- **Area 0**: Backbone area
- **Area 1**: Transit area
- **Area 2**: Non-backbone area that needs to connect to Area 0 through Area 1

## Topology
```html
Area 0          Area 1           Area 2
+------+        +------+        +------+        +------+
| R1   |--------| R2   |--------| R3   |--------| R4   |
+------+        +------+        +------+        +------+
10.1.1.0/24     12.0.0.0/24     23.0.0.0/24     34.0.0.0/24
RID: 1.1.1.1    RID: 2.2.2.2    RID: 3.3.3.3    RID: 4.4.4.4
```
## Configuration
To create a virtual link between R2 and R3, use the following commands:

### On Router R2
1. Enter OSPF configuration mode:
   ```bash
   R2(config)# router ospf 1
   ```
   
2. Create the virtual link:
     ```bash
     R2(config-router)# area 1 virtual-link 3.3.3.3
     ```
   
### On Router R3
1. Enter OSPF configuration mode:
     ```bash
    R3(config)# router ospf 1
     ```
   
2. Create the virtual link:
    ```bash
    R3(config-router)# area 1 virtual-link 2.2.2.2
    ```
   
## Explanation
- The router ospf 1 command enters the OSPF configuration mode for OSPF process ID 1.
- The area 1 virtual-link 3.3.3.3 command on R2 and area 1 virtual-link 2.2.2.2 command on R3 configure the virtual link. The router IDs of R3 (3.3.3.3) and R2 (2.2.2.2) are used to establish the virtual link.

This virtual link allows Area 2 to communicate with Area 0 through the transit Area 1, maintaining OSPF's hierarchical structure.

## Conclusion
Virtual links are a useful feature in OSPF for connecting areas that do not have a direct physical connection to the backbone area. Proper configuration ensures seamless routing across different areas within an OSPF domain.


# OSPF Authentication and OSPFv3

OSPF supports various authentication types to secure routing updates exchanged between OSPF routers. OSPFv2 (for IPv4) and OSPFv3 (for IPv6) have slightly different authentication mechanisms.

## OSPFv2 Authentication

### 1. None Authentication

No authentication is configured, and OSPF routers accept routing updates without any authentication check.

### Configuration Example:

```bash
router ospf 1
area 0 authentication null
```

- **Command Explanation**: This command configures Area 0 with no authentication (none).

### Verification:

To verify none authentication, check OSPF neighbor relationships:

```bash
show ip ospf neighbor
```

### Example Output:

```
Neighbor ID     Pri   State           Dead Time   Address         Interface
2.2.2.2         1     FULL/DR         00:00:39    192.168.1.2     GigabitEthernet0/0
```

## 2. Clear Text Authentication

Uses a simple password in clear text format for authentication between OSPF routers.

### Configuration Example:

```bash
router ospf 1
area 0 authentication message-digest
```

- **Command Explanation**: This command enables MD5 authentication for Area 0.

### Verification:

To verify clear text authentication, check OSPF neighbor authentication:

```bash
show ip ospf neighbor detail
```

### Example Output:

```
Neighbor 2.2.2.2, Interface address 192.168.1.2
    Neighbor is up, 00:00:38
    Authentication type: Simple password
    Authentication key: Cisco123
```

## 3. MD5 Authentication

Uses MD5 hashing for authentication between OSPF routers, providing stronger security than clear text.

### Configuration Example:

```bash
router ospf 1
area 0 authentication message-digest
area 0 authentication message-digest key 1 md5 <password>
```

- **Command Explanation**: This command enables MD5 authentication and configures the MD5 key for Area 0.

### Verification:

To verify MD5 authentication, check OSPF neighbor authentication:

```bash
show ip ospf interface brief
```

### Example Output:

```
Interface    PID   Area            IP Address/Mask    Cost  State Nbrs F/C
GigabitEthernet0/0   1     0             192.168.1.1/24   1     DR    1/1
```

## OSPFv3 Authentication

OSPFv3 uses the HMAC-SHA-256 authentication method for securing OSPFv3 routing updates.

### Configuration Example:

```bash
router ospfv3 1
area 0 authentication ipsec spi 256 md5 <password>
```

- **Command Explanation**: This command enables HMAC-SHA-256 authentication using MD5 for OSPFv3 Area 0.

### Verification:

To verify OSPFv3 authentication, check OSPFv3 interface details:

```bash
show ospfv3 interface
```

### Example Output:

```
OSPFv3 1, IPv6, area 0
Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, Interface ID 1
    OSPFv3 not enabled
```

### Considerations

- Choose OSPF authentication based on security requirements and compatibility with OSPF versions (OSPFv2 for IPv4, OSPFv3 for IPv6).
- Ensure consistent authentication settings across OSPF neighbors to maintain OSPF adjacency and routing stability.
- Periodically update OSPF authentication keys to enhance network security.
